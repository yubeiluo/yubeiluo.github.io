    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this blog, I will present you how to setup a successful and efficient Git workflow powered by the modern, excellent open source software that I have ever used, <strong>GitLab</strong>. The workflow aims to achieve the following targets:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Code Review. Cultivate a culture and good habit of of code review before code is accepted in the main line.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Continuous Integration. By default, every commit will trigger a build, which should include performing regression testing to discover failures earlier not later.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Continuous Delivery. Push to deploy should be in place to save the manual deploy effort.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For better organization, the topic will be discussed in two separate blogs with the first focused on the Git basics and second focused on the Gitlab. And this blog is the first one, in which, the inner workings and basic concepts of Git will be talked about at length.</p>
<h1 id="Background">Background</h1><p>TL;DR</p>
<p>What on earth am I blogging this for? Well, since my Git story could date back to year 2013 and GitLab to 2014. these are the real drivers for this blog:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When I joined the <a href="https://18birdies.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">18birdies dev team</a> half a year ago, <a href="https://subversion.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">SVN</a> is the only SCM tool being used for hosting the source code repositories of all the ongoing projects: iOS App, Android App, Server (Java), Web, etc. Ironically this is the same case for the previous <a href="http://www.mashanglc.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">company</a> that I worked for, where <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Git</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">GitLab</a> were successfully introduced and popularized with my effort.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Last week, we had a new seasoned front-end developer on-board, another Git addict like me (glab to have a company). After some rounds of debate with CTO, he finally agreed that we should start to use Git in place of SVN, but before that, an appropriate development workflow or SDLC should be proposed and standardized so that all the different teams could conduct the development in a cohesive and consistent way.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Git">Git</h1><h2 id="Why">Why</h2><p>I have summarized as follows a list of reasons why Git should be used instead of SVN:</p>
<ul>
<li>Git is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control" target="_blank" rel="external">DVCS</a>, which avoids the SPOF or single point of failure.</li>
<li>Git is <a href="#Branching">branching</a> friendly, where branching and merging is a superb lightweight operation.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds" target="_blank" rel="external">Linus</a> is Git’s author and Linus is my God!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Version_Control">Version Control</h2><p>Historically, there exists three types of version control systems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Local</li>
<li>Centralize</li>
<li>Distributed</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Local">Local</h3><p><img src="/uploads/A-Successful-GitLab-Workflow-Git-Basics/screenshot-1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>One example is the <strong>RCS</strong> command that is available in major Linux distributions. Here is how RCS works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calculating the diffs between each version</li>
<li>Storing the diffs or patches in a special format in disk</li>
<li>Re-recreate any file at any time by applying all the diffs since the initial version.</li>
</ul>
<p>Shortcomings:</p>
<ul>
<li>SPOF</li>
<li>Do Not scale</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Centralized">Centralized</h3><p><img src="/uploads/A-Successful-GitLab-Workflow-Git-Basics/screenshot-2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Examples are CVS, SVN, Perforce. And a typical one works like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>A single dedicated server that serves all the versioned files</li>
<li>A number of clients check out / in files from and to the server.</li>
</ul>
<p>Advantages over Local:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is communication among the team members since everyone knows to some extent what others are currently doing.</li>
<li>Authentication and Authorization. Admins could control what everyone could do.</li>
</ul>
<p>Flaws:</p>
<ul>
<li>SPOF. If the centralized server is down for some time, it becomes a blocker since nobody could do anything during the downtime: collaborate or save the changes. If the server’s disks become corrupted and there are no backups, the entire history of the project is lost.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Distributed">Distributed</h3><p><img src="/uploads/A-Successful-GitLab-Workflow-Git-Basics/screenshot-3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Examples are Git, Mercurial, Bazaar. And the fundamental difference is that the clients not only checkout the latest snapshot of the files but also fully mirrors the remote repository. Therefore, it provides the following bonuses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every clone is a full backup of all the data including the complete history</li>
<li>In case of server downtime, any of the client’s repository could be copied back to the server to restore it.</li>
<li>Client can work with multiple remote repositories simultaneously within the same project.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="History">History</h2><p>The following list is a brief summary about Git’s history based on the <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-A-Short-History-of-Git" target="_blank" rel="external">official history page</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>From 1991 to 2002, Linux Kernel were maintained via using patches.</li>
<li>In 2002, the project began to use a proprietary DVCS called BitKeeper.</li>
<li>In 2005, BitKeep started to charge the tool and the Linus Torvalds decided to develop their own tool based on the lessons learned when using BitKeeper with the following goals:<ol>
<li>Speed</li>
<li>Simple design</li>
<li>Strong support for non-linear development</li>
<li>Fully Distributed</li>
<li>Able to handle projects like the Linux Kernel efficiently (speed and data size)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Basic_Concepts">Basic Concepts</h2><ol>
<li><p>Snapshots not differences.</p>
<p>Conceptually, most other systems store information as a list of file-based changes. These systems (CVS, Subversion, Perforce, Bazaar, and so on) think of the information they keep as a set of files and the changes made to each file over time.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/A-Successful-GitLab-Workflow-Git-Basics/screenshot-4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Git thinks of its data more like a set of snapshots of a miniature filesystem. Git thinks about its data more like a stream of snapshots.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/A-Successful-GitLab-Workflow-Git-Basics/screenshot-5.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li><p>Nearly all operations are local.  </p>
<p>You could continue to work (create branches, make changes, commit) even when the remote repositories become not available.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Git has integrity.</p>
<p>All the contents are checksummed using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1" target="_blank" rel="external">SHA-1</a> so that Git is able to detect any malicious behavior and accidents that result in unintended content changes.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Disk corruption</p>
</li>
<li><p>DRAM corruption</p>
</li>
<li><p>Middle of Man Attack</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Git makes use of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree" target="_blank" rel="external">Merkle Tree</a> data structure for the purpose of efficient and secure validation of the contents of large data structures.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/A-Successful-GitLab-Workflow-Git-Basics/screenshot-9.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li><p>Git generally only add data.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The three states.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/A-Successful-GitLab-Workflow-Git-Basics/screenshot-6.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/uploads/A-Successful-GitLab-Workflow-Git-Basics/screenshot-7.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The basic workflow goes something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>You modify files in your working directory.</li>
<li>You stage the files, adding snapshots of them to your staging area.</li>
<li>You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot permanently to your Git directory.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Basic_Commands">Basic Commands</h2><ol>
<li><p>Each Git repository has a .git directory, storing metadata about the project, the most important of which is the history.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/A-Successful-GitLab-Workflow-Git-Basics/screenshot-8.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li><p>Run <strong>git init</strong> to create a git repository in an existing directory.</p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="built_in">cd</span> repo</span><br><span class="line">git init</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
</li>
<li><p>Run <strong>git clone</strong> to clone a remote repository (<strong>Make sure your ssh public keys are uploaded to the remote server</strong>).</p>
<figure class="highlight stylus"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">git clone git@gitlab<span class="class">.squarevalleytech</span><span class="class">.com</span>:<span class="number">18</span>bidies-frontend/web.git</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Configuration">Configuration</h3><p>Git stores its configuration in two places:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>~/.gitconfig (global, apply to all git repositories)</p>
</li>
<li><p>repo/.git/config (local, apply to local git repository, override the global one)</p>
</li>
<li><p>List the local configurations.</p>
<figure class="highlight stata"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">git config -<span class="keyword">l</span> --<span class="keyword">local</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
</li>
<li><p>List the global configurations.</p>
<figure class="highlight stata"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">git config -<span class="keyword">l</span> --<span class="keyword">global</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
</li>
<li><p>Add a local configuration item.</p>
<figure class="highlight stylus"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">git config user<span class="class">.name</span> davidyu</span><br><span class="line">git config user<span class="class">.email</span> davidyu@squarevalleytech.com</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Please go to the <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial" target="_blank" rel="external">official tutorial website</a> for an in-depth instructions about learning Git.</p>
<h2 id="Object_Model">Object Model</h2><p>In a nutshell, this is how the Git object model looks like conceptually:</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/A-Successful-GitLab-Workflow-Git-Basics/screenshot-16.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/uploads/A-Successful-GitLab-Workflow-Git-Basics/screenshot-17.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="Core">Core</h3><p>The first time you use Git, it’s almost a guarantee that you will feel confused from time to time about the usage of the monstrous command set, at lease it was true for me. And in order to clear away these confusions, it’s better to figure out what is happening beneath the covers from an implementation perspective.</p>
<p>So let’s start by creating an empty repository first named as object-model.</p>
<figure class="highlight scala"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">mkdir <span class="class"><span class="keyword">object</span><span class="title">-model</span></span><br><span class="line"></span>git init</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p><img src="/uploads/A-Successful-GitLab-Workflow-Git-Basics/screenshot-10.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Git will then create an <strong>.git</strong> directory where it stores the database for your project and this database contains the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>config: the project specific configuration</p>
</li>
<li><p>refs: the branches, remotes, tags</p>
</li>
<li><p>HEAD: store a reference to the current branch</p>
</li>
<li><p>objects: the object database</p>
</li>
<li><p>hooks: Git event system</p>
</li>
<li><p>index: the staging area for incoming changes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s add a README file and stage it.</p>
<figure class="highlight vim"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">echo</span> <span class="string">"This is the first line"</span> &gt; README</span><br><span class="line">git <span class="built_in">add</span> README</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p><img src="/uploads/A-Successful-GitLab-Workflow-Git-Basics/screenshot-11.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As it could be seen from the above screenshot, when a new file is staged, the following things will happen in Git:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Git creates a blob object with the hash of the file contents as the filename. In our case, the contents are <strong>This is the first line</strong>, and the hash is <strong>d3e2104b9e57bf5147ed403e1f8c4760302b9387</strong>. The leading two characters <strong>d3</strong> will be used to create a directory and the remained ones <strong>e2104b9e57bf5147ed403e1f8c4760302b9387</strong> will be used as the actual file name. The contents are compressed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Git stores a reference in the index that points to the new file README. (The index itself is essentially a tree object).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Update the index tree object.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Make our first commit.</p>
<figure class="highlight nginx"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="title">git</span> commit -m <span class="string">'first commit'</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p><img src="/uploads/A-Successful-GitLab-Workflow-Git-Basics/screenshot-12.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When staged changes are committed, Git will do:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create the same tree object as the index.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create a commit object with a reference to the tree.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Flip the tip of the current branch to point to the commit object.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that the <strong>README</strong> file is being tracked by Git, let’s make some modifications to it.</p>
<figure class="highlight ruby"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">echo <span class="string">"This is the second line"</span> <span class="prompt">&gt;&gt; </span><span class="constant">README</span></span><br><span class="line">git status</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p><img src="/uploads/A-Successful-GitLab-Workflow-Git-Basics/screenshot-13.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The changes are not staged yet, so let’s stage the changed file.<br><figure class="highlight armasm"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="label">git</span> <span class="keyword">add </span>README</span><br><span class="line"><span class="label">git</span> status</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p><img src="/uploads/A-Successful-GitLab-Workflow-Git-Basics/screenshot-14.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When you stage a tracked file, Git will do the same thing as staging a new file. That explains Git is indeed snapshotting instead of differencing between revisions or commits.</p>
<p>Finally, commit the changes.</p>
<figure class="highlight nginx"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="title">git</span> commit -m <span class="string">"second commit"</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p><img src="/uploads/A-Successful-GitLab-Workflow-Git-Basics/screenshot-15.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The only difference for this commit was that it stored a reference to the parent commit <strong>9d2864f</strong>, whereby forming a commit tree data structure, which is virtually project’s history.</p>
<h3 id="Branching">Branching</h3><p>Understand the Git’s object model is important before you could appreciate why Git supports non-linear development or branching very well. Let’s explore more by creating a new branch <strong>develop</strong>.</p>
<figure class="highlight puppet"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">git branch develop</span><br><span class="line">git checkout develop</span><br><span class="line">// <span class="keyword">or</span> <span class="keyword">in</span> one <span class="literal">command</span></span><br><span class="line">git checkout -b develop</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p><img src="/uploads/A-Successful-GitLab-Workflow-Git-Basics/screenshot-18.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When creating a new branch, what Git does is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a new reference named as the branch name in the <strong> .git/refs/heads </strong> directory, which points to the current commit object. In our case,  <strong> .git/refs/heads/develop =&gt; eb2ad539 </strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Flip the .git/HEAD to the new branch name. In our case, <strong> HEAD =&gt; /refs/heads/develop </strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When switching to an existing branch, Git will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update the index and working tree to the contents of the commit object that the branch points at. In our case, nothing happens since there are no changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>So in Git, branches are nothing more than a <strong>variable pointer</strong>, pointing at a certain tip of the commit tree. The same goes for tags, whereas tag is more like a <strong>constant pointer</strong>, recording important historical moments over the project’s history.</p>
<p>One philosophy of Git is that it advocates branching and merging frequently since they are the killer feature of it, allowing for concurrent development. The following workflow should be used for the development of new features:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a new feature branch from the develop branch and do your work there.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Commit changes locally, and when it is ready to share, push the changes to upstream.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When changes have been tested locally, it is ready to merge it into the develop branch.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Switch to the develop branch.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pull the latest from the upstream.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Perform a no fast forward merge with the feature branch and resolve conflicts if any.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Push the develop branch to upstream. And when everything is ok, delete the feature both locally and remotely.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A remote repository <strong>git@gitlab.squarevalleytech.com:demo/object-model.git</strong> was created and let’s add it in our local repository and setup the local master and develop branches to track the corresponding remote ones.</p>
<figure class="highlight stylus"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">git remote add origin git@gitlab<span class="class">.squarevalleytech</span><span class="class">.com</span>:demo/object-model<span class="class">.git</span></span><br><span class="line">git push -u origin master</span><br><span class="line">git push -u origin develop</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p><img src="/uploads/A-Successful-GitLab-Workflow-Git-Basics/screenshot-19.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Our PM assigned a new requirement about user management functionality and we started to work it out in a new feature branch as follows:</p>
<figure class="highlight dockerfile"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">git checkout -b feature/<span class="built_ins">user</span>-management</span><br><span class="line">echo "This is a fake <span class="built_ins">user</span> manager." &gt; UserManager.js</span><br><span class="line">git <span class="built_ins">add</span> .</span><br><span class="line">git commit -m "<span class="built_ins">add</span> a <span class="built_ins">user</span> manager"</span><br><span class="line">git push -u origin feature/<span class="built_ins">user</span>-management</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p><img src="/uploads/A-Successful-GitLab-Workflow-Git-Basics/screenshot-20.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Our QA found a blocker bug in the testing environment, and needed to be fixed ASAP. For simplicity, we switch back to the develop branch and fix the bug there.</p>
<figure class="highlight armasm"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="label">git</span> checkout develop</span><br><span class="line"><span class="label">echo</span> <span class="string">"This will fix the bug"</span> &gt;&gt; README</span><br><span class="line"><span class="label">git</span> <span class="keyword">add </span>.</span><br><span class="line"><span class="label">git</span> commit -m <span class="string">"fix bug 1"</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="label">git</span> <span class="keyword">push </span>origin</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p><img src="/uploads/A-Successful-GitLab-Workflow-Git-Basics/screenshot-21.png" alt=""></p>
<p>From this point on, the user-management feature branch diverged from the develop branch. And we switched back to the feature branch to continue from where we left off.</p>
<figure class="highlight ruby"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">git checkout feature/user-management</span><br><span class="line">echo <span class="string">"The second line."</span> <span class="prompt">&gt;&gt; </span><span class="constant">UserManager</span>.js</span><br><span class="line">echo <span class="string">"The fake user domain object."</span> <span class="prompt">&gt;&gt; </span><span class="constant">User</span>.js</span><br><span class="line">git add .</span><br><span class="line">git commit -m <span class="string">"add user"</span></span><br><span class="line">git push origin</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p><img src="/uploads/A-Successful-GitLab-Workflow-Git-Basics/screenshot-22.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Finally, after the new feature passed testing, it was time to merge it back to the develop branch.</p>
<figure class="highlight sql"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">git checkout develop</span><br><span class="line">git pull origin</span><br><span class="line">git <span class="operator"><span class="keyword">merge</span> feature/<span class="keyword">user</span>-management <span class="comment">--no-ff</span></span><br><span class="line">git push origin</span><br><span class="line">git checkout feature/<span class="keyword">user</span>-management</span><br><span class="line">git push origin :feature/<span class="keyword">user</span>-management</span><br><span class="line">git checkout develop</span><br><span class="line">git branch -d feature/<span class="keyword">user</span>-management</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s been almost a quarter since I joined the new team. For the recent month, all the efforts have been spent on the <strong>Mini ERP Project</strong> aiming to integrate internal workflows for increasing efficiency and boosting productivity. Proudly speaking, I have now transitioned to be a proficient front-end engineer within such a short period of time, so it is worth spending some more time in recording and more importantly summarizing the lessons learned in this unforgettable and challenging transition process.</p>
<h1 id="Facts_&amp;_Lessons">Facts &amp; Lessons</h1><ol>
<li><p>The first project is an existing one, developed by a seasoned front-end veteran, who was going to leave the team soon. The project was written in the <strong>MEAN</strong> stack using grunt as the build tool and helped enlighten me in various aspects of front-end engineering with enormous amount of working examples. The only cumbersome issue was that each time a new dependency was introduced, you had to manually wire them up in the main page, which obviously violates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle" target="_blank" rel="external">OCP principle</a>. BTW, Java is my favorite programming language and I am obsessed with software design principles and practices with over 4 years experience of server side engineering, 1 year hands-on architectural experience.</p>
</li>
<li><p>As was told by many friends, Angular indeed has a very steep learning curve compared to other frameworks and it took me no less than two weeks before the angular way of thinking came into being in my mentality. However, once you get used to it, the previous pains totally paid off because you now have a damn powerful weapon added to your arsenal, which could help to solve many intricate problems in many cases with less code written. The core angular concepts are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two-way data binding</li>
<li>Dependency injection,</li>
<li>Controllers</li>
<li>Services</li>
<li>Service providers</li>
<li>Scope and scope inheritance</li>
<li>Filters</li>
</ul>
<p>It is worth pointing out that you can not claim to be an Angular artisan unless you comprehend the inner workings of the directives and are capable of rolling out customized ones to suite your own use case.</p>
</li>
<li><p>GulpJs is a better build tool compared to GruntJs because of the following two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It favors the concept of “coding over configuration”, which makes the code feel more explicit and readable, thus much easier for you to figure out what is going on.</li>
<li>It out-performs GruntJs by working in a streaming manner just like Unix pipes. In GulpJs, almost everything is performed in memory and no intermediary file storage is required, thus saving tremendous amount of disk-io related time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/Swiip/generator-gulp-angular" target="_blank" rel="external">Angular+GulpJs generator</a> is awesome in that you do not feel the hassle of wiring up dependencies manually in the main page any more since they are sorted out by the <a href="https://github.com/klei/gulp-angular-filesort" target="_blank" rel="external">angular-file-sort plugin</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You should start way much earlier to experiment and prototype before the backend team kicks off and definitely do not wait until the backend API is ready. Nodejs + express could be leveraged to mock the real api and provide some fake data in order to make the whole workflow run.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Usability is important and you should always think from the perspective of the end users and make bold suggestions when necessary. Take the below comparison as an example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The origin detail page design</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/Lessons-Learned-Transition-to-Frontend/screenshot-5.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li><p>The proposed design</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/Lessons-Learned-Transition-to-Frontend/screenshot-4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As you can see, since the detail page is very lengthy, it will be very handy for an left-side navigation bar to be present when users are scrolling around.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>You should have a consistent error handling process in place to make troubleshooting a straightforward and time-saving task when something goes wrong.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/Lessons-Learned-Transition-to-Frontend/screenshot-6.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Finished_Product">Finished Product</h1><p>Although the product is far from being perfect, I still would like to show off some highlights.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/Lessons-Learned-Transition-to-Frontend/screenshot-4.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/uploads/Lessons-Learned-Transition-to-Frontend/screenshot-7.png" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="/uploads/Lessons-Learned-Transition-to-Frontend/screenshot-9.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/uploads/Lessons-Learned-Transition-to-Frontend/screenshot-10.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/uploads/Lessons-Learned-Transition-to-Frontend/screenshot-11.png" alt=""></p>
<h1 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h1><p>It will be great if this long post will be of any use for other backend engineers who also feel tempted to give it a shot in the front-end arena.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today, I would like to share with you some css tricks that were discovered and learned in my own project, where they were employed to place a play icon in the middle of an image.</p>
<h1 id="Background">Background</h1><p>During my recent development of a web ui for managing the post library (user can see the list and perform actions on each of them), it is needed to render the UI based on the post type. For the post with attached video, it is required to display the <strong>play</strong> icon in the center of the video snapshot image that could be simply clicked by the user to play the video.</p>
<h1 id="Desired_Effect">Desired Effect</h1><p>One picture is worth than thousands words and here comes the snapshot.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/Use-Css-After-Psuedo-Element-To-Center-Play-Icon/snapshot-1.png" alt=""></p>
<h1 id="Tricky_Things">Tricky Things</h1><p>In order to achieve the wanted functionality, it was not an easy task for me since I just re-picked up the web tech stack two months ago due to lack of labor and lots of stuff has changed dramatically.</p>
<p>The most unpleasant issue I feel with front-end development is the enormous details that one has to take care of, such as the gigantic css rules. And it is very likely to forget the technique that was previously used.</p>
<p>Next, I will talk about the facts and findings that were learned.</p>
<h2 id="CSS_Positions">CSS Positions</h2><p>There are four possible values for the css <strong>position</strong> property per the below table.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left">Value</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">static</td>
<td>the default value</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">relative</td>
<td>relative to the original position and will stay in the normal document structure</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">absolute</td>
<td>relative to the first positioned parent element and will be removed from the document structure</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">fixed</td>
<td>relative to the viewport and will stay in the normal document structure</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Please be noted that when positioned as absolute, the following statements hold true:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The element will become an inline-block element and its width and height will auto-adjust to the contained elements.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The parent element will not any reserve space for it and therefore overlapping could occur.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The element will be positioned relative to the first positioned parent element that has the position property set to a value other than <strong>static</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Pseudo_Elements">Pseudo Elements</h2><p>What the hell are them? You may wonder the same as I did the first time when I heard the words. Actually, they are basically css rules like <strong>a:after,a:before</strong> that can 1) add more flexibility than plain javascript 2) remove unnecessary html code. Here are some facts to bear in mind.<br><figure class="highlight css"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="rule"><span class="attribute">a</span>:<span class="value">before&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  display: block</span></span>;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="rule"><span class="attribute">width</span>:<span class="value"> <span class="number">40px</span></span></span>;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="rule"><span class="attribute">content</span>:<span class="value"><span class="string">"the content will be inserted before the a's content"</span></span></span>;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<ol>
<li><p>They do not appear in the DOM and are rendered by the css renderer. Henceforth, it is not possible to manipulate them via javascript.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The content property <strong>CAN NOT</strong> be missing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The default display value is inline and can be modified to suit your needs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="The_Solution">The Solution</h1><p>Okay, it is time to put all the pieces together to have the whole picture.</p>
<p>First, the html markup:<br><figure class="highlight html"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">div</span> <span class="attribute">class</span>=<span class="value">"my-video-content"</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">img</span> <span class="attribute">ng-src</span>=<span class="value">"&#123;&#123;feed.video.thumbnailUrl&#125;&#125;"</span> <span class="attribute">alt</span>=<span class="value">""</span> <span class="attribute">class</span>=<span class="value">"img-thumbnail"</span>/&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">a</span> <span class="attribute">href</span>=<span class="value">"#"</span> <span class="attribute">ng-click</span>=<span class="value">"playVideo(feed)"</span>&gt;</span><span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="title">a</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="title">div</span>&gt;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>Secondly, the css styles:<br><figure class="highlight css"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="class">.my-video-content</span> <span class="rules">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">	<span class="rule"><span class="attribute">position</span>:<span class="value"> relative</span></span>;</span><br><span class="line">	<span class="rule"><span class="attribute">display</span>:<span class="value"> inline-block</span></span>;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="class">.my-video-content</span> <span class="rule"><span class="attribute">a</span>:<span class="value">after &#123;</span><br><span class="line">	font-family: <span class="string">"Glyphicons Halflings"</span></span></span>;</span><br><span class="line">	<span class="rule"><span class="attribute">-webkit-font-smoothing</span>:<span class="value"> antialiased</span></span>;</span><br><span class="line">	<span class="rule"><span class="attribute">content</span>:<span class="value"> <span class="string">"\e029"</span></span></span>;</span><br><span class="line">	<span class="rule"><span class="attribute">font-size</span>:<span class="value"> <span class="number">40px</span></span></span>;</span><br><span class="line">	<span class="rule"><span class="attribute">line-height</span>:<span class="value"> <span class="number">40px</span></span></span>;</span><br><span class="line">	<span class="rule"><span class="attribute">width</span>:<span class="value"> <span class="number">40px</span></span></span>;</span><br><span class="line">	<span class="rule"><span class="attribute">height</span>:<span class="value"> <span class="number">40px</span></span></span>;</span><br><span class="line">	<span class="rule"><span class="attribute">position</span>:<span class="value"> absolute</span></span>;</span><br><span class="line">	<span class="rule"><span class="attribute">top</span>:<span class="value"> <span class="number">50%</span></span></span>;</span><br><span class="line">	<span class="rule"><span class="attribute">left</span>:<span class="value"> <span class="number">50%</span></span></span>;</span><br><span class="line">	<span class="rule"><span class="attribute">margin</span>:<span class="value"> -<span class="number">20px</span> <span class="number">0</span> <span class="number">0</span> -<span class="number">20px</span></span></span>;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<h2 id="Explanation">Explanation</h2><ol>
<li><p>The dimension of the video snapshot image is dynamic, so we need to have a container to have its width auto-adjust to that of the enclosed image. By default, the width of a div container will flow to 100% of its parent’s width and that is exactly where <strong>display=inline-block</strong> came to the rescue.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <strong>.my-video-content a:after</strong> element is now positioned relative to the <strong>.my-video-content</strong> container and we also need to set both the top and left to 50% so that the left corner of the icon box is sitting in the middle of the image.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The goal is to center the icon box not the left corner, so we need to offset both the top and left margin to half of the icon’s height and width.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h1><p>Hopefully, the above tips could come to help and inspire your own development and please do not hesitate to correct me if anything I wrote above is wrong.</p>

    <published>2015-06-29T08:36:02.000Z</published>
    <updated>2015-06-30T09:51:10.000Z</updated>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://github.com/winstonjs/winston" target="_blank" rel="external">Winston</a> is a great library for asynchronous logging in nodejs applications. It has the wonderful abstraction of transport where log messages will be delivered to and several built-in transports are provided out of the box per the below table (the list is incomplete).</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left">Transport Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Console</td>
<td>Log the messages in the console</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">File</td>
<td>Log the messages in a file such as <strong>app.log</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">DailyRotateFile</td>
<td>Log the message in a file that rotates bases upon rules like the capped file size, date pattern</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For a production setup, you will find the <strong>DailyRotateFile</strong> transport useful since it could rotate your log files automatically based on the rules which are configurable.</p>
<h2 id="Problems">Problems</h2><p>If you follow the instructions outlined in the official winston repo, it is very likely that you will feel as surprised as I do. To summarize, here is a list of issues that make me feel uncomfortable sorted by the level from the most serious to the least.</p>
<h3 id="Message_Loss">Message Loss</h3><p>Yes!! You hear me, some messages will fail to be delivered to the log file. This is what exactly happened to my environment, where there are two transports configured, one is the <strong>Console</strong> and the other is the <strong>DailyRotateFile</strong>. After the app bootstraps, by comparing the messages between the console and the file, it is observed that some message will become lost in the file. Since logging is such as vital part of an application, how could you endure and afford the consequences of any message losses?</p>
<h3 id="Not_Tailer_Friendly">Not Tailer Friendly</h3><p>I admit that it is the OCD that helps to forge a habit that every time before an app is run, I will open another terminal to tail the app log file to see if everything goes on smoothly as expected and this command is often an alias defined in the bash profile such as</p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="built_in">alias</span> app.log=tail <span class="operator">-f</span> <span class="variable">$APP_HOME</span>/logs/app.log</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>But when using the <strong>DailyRotateFile</strong> transport, the file name is dynamic according to the configured rules. The default value is the configured file name plus the current date suffix in the <strong>yyyy-mm-dd</strong> format like <strong>app.2015-06-29.log</strong>.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that there is no way to define a permanent alias to tail the log file since the file name changes and it would be handy if the transport could produce a file that never changes its name but still contains the latest log messages.</p>
<p>What about a symbolic link file that always links to the up-to-date log file and changes as well when the underlying file changes?</p>
<h2 id="Solution">Solution</h2><p>After reading the source code of winston, I have decided to fork the <a href="https://github.com/mallocator/Winston-Rolling-File-Appender" target="_blank" rel="external">Winston-Rolling-File-Appender</a> and roll out my own version of <strong>DailyRotateFile</strong> transport. Please go to <a href="https://github.com/yubeiluo/Winston-Rolling-File-Appender" target="_blank" rel="external">Another-Winston-Rolling-File-Appender</a> for furthur details about this little tranport that makes my life eaiser. Hopefully it could help you as well if by any chance you are suffering from the same issues.</p>
